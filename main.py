### 4. **`main.py`**
This is your main program file, which will start the calculator. Here's an example of how it might look:

```python
from app.calculator import calculator

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start the calculator REPL
    print("Starting Calculator...")
    calculator()


The main.py file imports the calculator function from your app/calculator.py and starts the program when you run python main.py.
